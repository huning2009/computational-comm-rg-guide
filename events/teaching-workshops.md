# Teaching Workshops

Teaching workshops are opportunities for people to learn about new programming tools from one another. They primarily serve two of our three mandates: to offer learning opportunities to students and to train graduate students in programming pedagogy. For this research, all teaching workshops should be led by graduate students, to give them an opportunity to hone their teaching skills.
