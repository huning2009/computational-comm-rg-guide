# Teaching Workshops
Teaching workshops are a great way to introduce a new topic to your research group. 

In a university a teaching workshop can supplement courses that are taught in a deparment. However, these workshops can facilitate a wider audience and should not depend on information taught in a specific class. A workshop you teach for your department can be open to graduate students across your campus. You can also record your workshop and post it on Youtube for others to see, or convert it into an online tutorial. 

A workshop should cover one topic, method, package or library. An ideal workshop should be at least 45 minutes or an hour (if it's shorter, you should be able to make a guide easily). Workshops that last a full day, or multiple days, should be considered boot camps.

## Stand-Alone versus Regular Workshops
Workshops can be stand-alone events or coordinated as a sort-of curriculum. 

Stand-alone events should be announced a month before it takes place, so that you have an opportunity to promote that workshop. Coordinated workshops should be announced together. Following an academic schedule, I recommend providing a schedule of workshops at the beginning of each semester. Planning workshops together, before the start of a semester, will give you an opportunity to develop a “workshop arc”, much like you would organize a syllabus. For example, you probably want your workshop attendees to learn how to scrape their own data before you teach them how to perform statistical analyses on that data.

## Tips and tricks
* It helps to have two or three consistent datasets that are used throughout the year. I recommend:
  * One well-known toy dataset (mtcars, iris, airplane)
  * One Twitter corpus
  * One news corpus
* Workshops should become increasingly more advanced over time
  * It helps to have an “intro to R” and/or “intro to data science” workshop at the beginning of the semester
* Materials should be produced on rmarkdown or Jupyter Notebooks for replicability and readability.
  * Materials should be publicly available, though we understand that these materials are for teaching in a presentation setting.
* Materials for all workshops should be organized and available (we have used box, but Google Drive and Dropbox are equally acceptable).    * Workshop materials should be properly attributed to their author.
* Send out workshop reminders the day before Friday.
  * Not every workshop will need a follow up, but follow-up emails help with retention.
