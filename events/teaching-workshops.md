# Teaching Workshops
Teaching workshops are a great way to introduce a new topic to your research group. 

In a university a teaching workshop can supplement courses that are taught in a deparment. However, these workshops can facilitate a wider audience and should not depend on information taught in a specific class. A workshop you teach for your department can be open to graduate students across your campus. You can also record your workshop and post it on Youtube for others to see, or convert it into an online tutorial. 

A workshop should cover one topic, method, package or library. An ideal workshop should be at least 45 minutes or an hour (if it's shorter, you should be able to make a guide easily). Workshops that last a full day, or multiple days, should be considered boot camps.

## Stand-Alone versus Regular Workshops
Workshops can be stand-alone events or coordinated as a sort-of curriculum. 

Stand-alone events should be announced a month before it takes place, so that you have an opportunity to promote that workshop. Coordinated workshops should be announced together. Following an academic schedule, I recommend providing a schedule of workshops at the beginning of each semester. Planning workshops together, before the start of a semester, will give you an opportunity to develop a “workshop arc”, much like you would organize a syllabus. For example, you probably want your workshop attendees to learn how to scrape their own data before you teach them how to perform statistical analyses on that data. 

## Programming Pedagogy 


## Facilitating a Wide Range of Knowledge 
One of the things that makes computational methods resarch groups interesting is the wide range of experiences. Some members of your CMRG are going to be experts at a method or programming language, while others are just starting out. Of the events we discuss here, it is especially difficult to manage this in a teaching worksohp setting. However, there are ways of ensuring that your experienced coders remain engaged, while your new coders learn from the experts.

### Surveying Prior to Your Workshop
If you are running a workshop and you do not know the people who are attending, I storngly encourage you to send out a registration survey or pre-workshop survey, so you can learn about the experience level of your workshop participants. For example, if you are teaching a workshop on ensemble classifiers in Python, you want to make sure your participants are proficient in that language. 

### Teaching Assistants
Experienced programmers can often serve as teaching assistants, helping out other coders throughout a workshop. This also helps the workshop presenter, who would otherwise have to stop a lecture to help a person. 

### Adding Challenging Activities
Add additional challenges to activities throughout a workshop. This can come in the form of more advanced tasks that are added onto different coding practice moments.

## Example Curriculums

## Tips and tricks
* It helps to have two or three consistent datasets that are used throughout the year. I recommend:
  * One well-known toy dataset
  * One Twitter corpus with network data
  * One news corpus
* Workshops should become increasingly more advanced over time
  * It helps to have an “intro to data science” and/or "intro to statistics" workshop at the beginning of the semester
* Materials should be produced on rmarkdown or Jupyter Notebooks for replicability and readability.
  * Materials should be publicly available, though we understand that these materials are for teaching in a presentation setting.
* Materials for all workshops should be organized and available.  
  * Workshop materials should be properly attributed to their author.
* Send out meeting reminders the day before the workshop.
  * Not every workshop will need a follow up, but follow-up emails help with retention. Consider sending them!
