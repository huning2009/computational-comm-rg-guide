# Organizing a Boot Camp

Bootcamps require a different orgaizational structure compared to teaching worksohps. Below are some important scheduling deadlines:

* Book rooms for a boot camp at least 4 to 6 months before the event
  * The location and the date are the most important details of the event
*	Promotion for the bootcamp should begin at least 2 months before it begins
*	Remind participants a week before, and then a day before, about the bootcamp. Students will often forget that they have registered otherwise.
*	Materials for the bootcamp should be uploaded before the workshop begins, though we understand that there are occasionally time restraints that prevent this.
*	There should be no more than 5-10 attendees per teacher during a workshop. That means if there are three teachers, there should be no more than 30 students. People serving as “teaching assistants” can also help out (3-5 students per teaching assistant)
  * 2 teachers + 1 TA = 25 students max
  * Teachers: People who are lecturing, showing code, or guiding activities that are a part of the workshop
  * Teaching assistants: People who have offered to help others when they are struggling with code.
