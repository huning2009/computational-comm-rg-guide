# Events
This folder is a resource for the many types of events you can organize for your CMRG. A list and description of them can be found below. Most events can be adopted for both online and offline research groups. 

## [1] Research Teams
**Active Learning | Online & Offline | 3-10 people**

Research teams are groups of three to ten people, organized by a team leader, who work together to complete a research project or answer a research question of their interest. Research teams can be a long-term, ongoing endeavor, or they can last the span of one or two papers. Research teams in computational methods research groups should use computational methods to answer a social science question,  attempt to advance computational methods tools, or both. 

It is possible for members of a research team to come from multiple universities. However, it is the responsibility of the team lead to facilitate communication across all the team members, so as to not leave anyone out of the loop. Research teams usually begin with a primary topic of interest, and a few methods or strategies for answering questions about that topic. 

To make regular progress on a research project, I recommend that research teams should meet every other week or weekly (especially if a deadline is looming). Leaders of research teams should send two emails throughout the week: a reminder email the day before a meeting, and a post-meeting email with notes and reminders about assignments/commitments.

## [2] Teaching Workshops
**Learning New Methods | Offline & Recorded | 5+ people**

Teaching workshops are opportunities for people to learn about new programming tools. They primarily serve two of our three mandates: (1) to teach people about computational methods, package, and libraries and (2) to train people in programming pedagogy. For this research, most teaching workshops should be facilitated by members of your computational methods research group, to give them an opportunity to hone their teaching skills.

Workshops should occur regularly (weekly, every-other-week, or monthly would be optimal). In a department that has computational methods courses, teaching workshops should complement what is being taught in the course. However, workshops can facilitate a wider audience and should not depend on information being taught in a specific course. For example, a workshop that you teach in an academic setting can be open to graduate students across your campus. You can also record that workshop and make it available on Youtube, or convert the material into an online tutorial. 

## [3] Boot Camps / Workshop Series
**Learning New Methods | Offline & Recorded | 5+ people**

Bootcamps are a special type of workshop that takes place over multiple consecutive days (typically, 2 to 4) or for a long period of time (e.g., 6 hours). These boot camps should be focused on rigorously teaching a specific method, often ones that would take too long to teach in a typical teaching workshop. Boot camps are substantially more in-depth than teaching workshops. For example, if you want to delve into the statistics of different supervised machine learing algorithms for text classification in addition to coding, you likely want substantially longer than 2 hours to teach. 

Example workshop topics include Hierarchical Linear Modeling, Machine Learning Algorithms, and Time Series analysis. For an example workshop, check out Josephine Lukito and Jordan Foley's Time Series Boot Camp. 

## [4] Presentations, brown bags, symposiums, colloquiums
**Discussion | Offline & Recorded | 7+ people**

These are all events where one person comes in and discusses their work. They vary in levels of professionalism. Below are some general definitions to help you better-label your event.

* **Presentation:** All-encompassing term for events in which a presentation is occurring. All subsequent terms listed below are types of presentations.
*	**Brown bags:** These are informal presentations, made by graduate students and guests. The term originates from meetings done during lunch (where people would bring lunch packed in brown bags). Brown bags need not occur during lunch, but the name speaks to its informality.
* **Colloquiums:** These are academic seminars, each taught by a different presenter. These are slightly more formal than brown bags. 
*	**Symposiums:** These are guest-invited presentations that occur a few times a semester (fewer than once a month). Sometimes, colloquium and symposium are treated as interchangeable terms.

These events greatly benefit from funding in two ways. With funding, you can pay for travel for speakers from other institutions or companies. With funding, you can also pay for food, which greatly increases in-person attendance.

These events should also be recorded to build an online audience.

## [5] Conferences & Unconferences
**Discussion | Offline | 10+ people**

For online computational research groups, annual conferences are be a good opportunity to meet regularly. Conferences are also a good way to bring together researchers interested in a specific topic and to promote your research group's work to conference attendees. These take a substantially longer amount of time to plan and organize compared to some of the other events here, because you will have to take into account (1) multiple meeting times, (2) a multi-day schedule, and (3) lodging for any guests. 

## [6] Coding Days
**Programming Practice | Offline & Online | 3+ people**

These are simply days where people get together to work on coding projects. They can work on their own projects, work through some teaching material, or coordinate activities with others. This is simply an opportunity for people to meet together and code, so that we can ask questions from one another.

Coding days can take place offline and online.

## [7] Regularly Scheduled Challenges
**Programming Practice | On Your Own Time | N/A** 

One way to encourage regular participation is to send a coding practice challenge (similar to a writing prompt, but for programming). This will encourage your resarch group members to work with different types of data and improve their programming skills.

You also don't need to re-invent the wheel. There are many online challenges that you can promote in your own research group! I list a few below:

1. [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): Weekly data science challenges in R (each week is a new dataset).
2. [Storytelling with Data](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/swdchallenge): Weekly anguage-neutral challenges about data visualization.
3. [PyBites](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html): Weekly challenges in Python.

It is important to keep in mind that these events are **not** competitions. They are opporutnities for your members to practice code and work with data. You can also learn a lot about a dataset if you have five or six different programmers working with the same data.
