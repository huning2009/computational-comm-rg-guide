# Finding Places to Meet
One of the most important things you'll have to think about is where you will be meeting, whether online or offline. A meeting place, whether a chatroom or a real room, is a critical part of your computational methods research group's (CMRG's) infrastructure. For other organizational considerations, please see the organizational folder.
