# Organizational Files
As I mentioned in the introduction, organizing is essential to maintaining a Computational Methods Research Group (CMRG). 

## Budget
When you start your CMRG, you will likely be working with a zero or shoestring budget (i.e., you will have little to no money). That's totally okay! Most events don't require funding (or if they do, not a significant amount). However, if you want to bring food to your events or host larger functions (e.g., unconferences), make sure you schedule at least two months in the year for seeking sponsorship. 

Another way to get funding, specifically for research teams and workshops, would be to request grants. 

## Recruitment
Recruitment is necessary to keep the group healthy. Every year, members move, become too busy, and vary in their commitment to the group (understandably so--life changes, after all). In order to maintain the group, CMRG members need to recruit and invite in new participants. In addition to recruiting members, it is the responsibility of the lead to encourage that members take on leadership roles, such as teaching workshops, running research teams, or organizing events. This process is an important learning mechanic within computational methods research groups: members are expected to "pay it forward" and help less experienced members of a research group.

Following a University calendar, recruitment is done primarily at the beginning of the semester, although I encourage you to actively recruit throughout the year. 

### Online Recruitment
For online research groups, you can look for new members on different social media platforms, including Twitter, Reddit, and Github. Think carefully about how to construct short, salient messages that will attract members. Because of the casual nature of social media, you can also use humor to your advantage. For example, using memes and GIFs may make your message stand out.

### Offline Recruitment
In **universities**, you can recruit members in a variety of ways. First, send emails to your department and other departments that may be interested in your events. You'll want to think about whether you want these events to be open to undergraduate and graduate students, or just graduate students. 

Second, consider putting up flyers in the departments that you have sent emails to. Flyers can be a useful way of reminding people about an event (if someone recently saw your email, flyers also reinforce the message). 

## Publicity
Even if your group meets exclusively offline, it is important to have a digital presence to make others aware of the research and work you are doing.

Members of the CMRG should also reach out to computational communities on Twitter. The easiest way to do so is using hashtags. There are language-specific hashtags like #rstats and #python, as well as topic-specific hashtags like #nlproc and #networkanalysis. This can help your members stay up to date with Python libraries and R packages, and learn about upcoming grants, workshops, or conference opportunities.

## Organizing tools

### Github
[Github Website](https://github.com/)

A space to house and manage code and work, using the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Slack
[Slack Website](https://slack.com/)

A chatting system to connect members of your CMRG.

### Cloud Storage (Box, Google Drive, etc.)
[Box Website](https://www.box.com/home) | [Google Drive Website](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) | [Dropbox Website](https://www.dropbox.com)

A secure place to store data and other documents.

### Email Mailing List

It's a good idea to keep a list of emails from your members. This is the most common way of distributing official or formal messages on behalf of your group (e.g., meeting reminders, call for papers, event announcements). You want to make sure you curate and manage your mailing list every year.

### Public Outreach (website, Twitter account, etc.)

It's a good idea for your CMRG to have a front-facing "digital space", to inform others about your work and to recruit new members. You can do so by hosting a website or making a social media account (I recommend Twitter, as it has active computational network already).
