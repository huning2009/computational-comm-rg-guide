# So you want to start a CMRG

Congratulations! Welcome to the first step to the exciting process of starting and maintaining a computational methods research group.

If you're interested in starting a research group, you'll need to think about the specifics of your group. For example, are you open to working with programmers in R and Python? Would you be willing to teach in Java? 

## Set Purpose
The most important thing you'll have to decide is the purpose of the research group you are organizing. Are you hoping to provide an opportunity for people to practice and learn? Are you trying to bring people who are interested in a specific research question or use a specific language? Do you want to engage in academic research?

Establish a one or two-sentence purpose statement for your group. Your purpose statement should express what your research group is trying to achieve, for your members, campus, research community, or something else.

## Set Goals
Setting goals every year will help your research group grow and develop. Your goals should be SMART--specific, measured, attainable, realistic, and truthful. It's important to make sure you record and vocalize your goals, as [writing the goals down will help you achieve them](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201803/goal-setting-is-linked-higher-achievement). Expressing your research group's goals to fellow members and potential members will also give you the opportunity to receive feedback that can improve those goals and will motivate others to help the research group achieve its goals.

Below are some goals you may want to set:
* Do you want a certain number of participants in your research group by the end of the year?
* How many events do you want to run? 
* Do you want to submit a paper to a conference or publication?
* Are there funding goals that would help you organize future events?
* In terms of outreach, is there a follower count you would like to achieve on social media?
* Is there any software you want to produce? 

It is important to keep in mind that your  group's goals will evolve throughout the year. Your list of goals should be a "living document", meaning that it changes depending on what your CMRG is doing and what its focused on. You should evaluate your group's goals, and your progress towards them, every other month to every six months.

Try not to set no more than three to five goals every year. This is important to making sure your list of goals are **attainable** and **realistic**. The more ambitious your goals, the fewer of them you should have.

## Set Range of Participation
You'll want to decide what kinds of members you want for your research group. There are two main types of groups: **online and offline** (keeping in mind that online groups can meet offline, and offline groups often have digital presences). Online groups communicate digitally and can come from anywhere. Most of the events for these research groups, therefore, should be online. Online groups need a strong digital infrastructure (e.g., chat system for meeting, space to code collaboratively or host workshops) in order to maintain a presence and grow followers. Online groups are great for bringing together computational researchers from across differet universities, cities, and even countries. 

Offline research groups can be based in a campus (e.g., a research group of graduate students) or a geographic region (e.g., a research group of programmers in NYC). These research groups can meet together in-peson, allowing for an easier transformation of information and the possibility of social events (bowling is just not the same online, for example). 

You can also build a hybrid out of these two strategies. Perhaps you want to organize a group that meets regularly every other month, but has weekly activities and meetings every other week. This is do-able! It really depends on what you want to achieve with your group, and how quickly you hope to achieve it. 

Below are some core questions you should ask yourself while you structure your research group:
* Would you like to meet online, offline, or both?
* Is your research group focused on a specific method (e.g., network analysis, NLP) or is it more general?
* Which programming languages does your research group support?
* Is your research group for a specific audience (e.g., graduate students, academics, industry professionals) or is it open to everyone within a region?
* If your research group is academic, would it be open to members from other universities?

## Determine how regularly you are meeting
Your meetings should be regularly, but how frequently they occur is mostly up to you and your members. Keep in mind that people are busy and may not have the time to accomodate multiple weekly in-person meetings. Sometimes, a meeting every other week, or even once a month, is enough. 

You will likely modify how often you meet based on your membership. For example, you may begin meeting once a month, but find that your members want to meet more frequenty. Keep in mind that your organizational strategy should change as your research group develops.
